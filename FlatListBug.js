In React Native, using a FlatList with a large dataset can lead to performance issues if not optimized correctly.  Improper key extraction, failure to use `getItemLayout` for known item sizes, or neglecting to implement `removeClippedSubviews` can cause significant lag or jank.  Also, unnecessary re-renders within the item components can compound the problem. For example, using a computationally expensive function inside the `renderItem` function without memoization can degrade performance substantially.
